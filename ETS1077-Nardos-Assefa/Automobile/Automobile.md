## **Input**
1. `fuel_tank_capacity`: The car's fuel tank capacity (in gallons).
2. `miles_per_gallon`: The car's fuel efficiency (in miles per gallon).

---

## **Process**
1. Prompt the user to enter the car's fuel tank capacity (`fuel_tank_capacity`).
2. Prompt the user to enter the car's fuel efficiency (`miles_per_gallon`).
3. Compute the total distance the car can travel without refueling using the formula:  
   \[
   \text{num\_miles} = \text{fuel\_tank\_capacity} \times \text{miles\_per\_gallon}
   \]
4. Display the calculated distance (`num_miles`) to the user.

---

## **Output**
- The total distance the car can travel without refueling (`num_miles`).

## **Pseudocode**

1. **Start**
2. Declare variables:
   - `fuel_tank_capacity` as float
   - `miles_per_gallon` as float
   - `num_miles` as float
3. Print "Enter your car's fuel tank capacity in gallons:"
4. Input `fuel_tank_capacity`
5. Print "Enter the miles per gallon your car can be driven:"
6. Input `miles_per_gallon`
7. Calculate `num_miles` as:
   \[
   \text{num\_miles} = \text{fuel\_tank\_capacity} \times \text{miles\_per\_gallon}
   \]
8. Print "Your car can be driven ", `num_miles`, " miles without refueling."
9. **End**
