# **Pseudo Code for Inverted Half Pyramid**

## **Input**
No explicit input from the user.

## **Output**
A solid inverted right-angled triangle pattern made of asterisks (`*`), with 6 rows:

## **Pseudo Code**

1. **Start the program.**

2. **Outer Loop (rows):**
   - Initialize `i` to `6`.
   - Loop until `i >= 1` (inclusive):
     - Each iteration represents one row of the inverted pyramid.

3. **Inner Loop (columns):**
   - Initialize `j` to `i`.
   - Loop until `j >= 1` (inclusive):
     - Print an asterisk (`*`).

4. **End of Inner Loop:**
   - After printing all asterisks for one row, **print a newline** character to move to the next row.

5. **End of Outer Loop:**
   - Repeat steps 3-4 until all 6 rows are printed.

6. **Stop the program.**
