## **Pseudo Code**

1. **Start the program.**

2. **Outer Loop (rows):**
   - Initialize `i` to `1`.
   - Loop until `i <= 5` (inclusive):
     - Each iteration represents one row of the pattern.

3. **Inner Loop (columns):**
   - Initialize `j` to `1`.
   - Loop until `j <= i` (inclusive):
     - Print the current value of `j` with a space after it.

4. **End of Inner Loop:**
   - After printing all numbers for one row, **print a newline** character to move to the next row.

5. **End of Outer Loop:**
   - Repeat steps 3-4 until all 5 rows are printed.

6. **Stop the program.**
