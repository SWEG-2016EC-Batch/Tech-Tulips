## **Output**
A reversed right-angled triangle pattern of numbers:


---

## **Pseudo Code**

1. **Start the program.**

2. **Outer Loop (rows):**
   - Initialize `i` to `1`.
   - Loop until `i <= 5` (inclusive):
     - Each iteration represents one row of the pattern.

3. **First Inner Loop (spaces):**
   - Initialize `j` to `5`.
   - Loop until `j > i` (exclusive):
     - Print a space (" ") to create the right alignment.

4. **Second Inner Loop (numbers):**
   - Initialize `k` to `i`.
   - Loop until `k >= 1` (inclusive):
     - Print the value of `k`.

5. **End of Inner Loops:**
   - After printing numbers for one row, **print a newline** character to move to the next row.

6. **End of Outer Loop:**
   - Repeat steps 3-5 until all 5 rows are printed.

7. **Stop the program.**
