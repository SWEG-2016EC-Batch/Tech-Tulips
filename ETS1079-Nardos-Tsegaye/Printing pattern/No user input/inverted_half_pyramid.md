## Pattern: Inverted half pyramid

### Input
1. No explicit input from the user.

### Output
1. A solid inverted right-angled triangle pattern made of asterisks (`*`), with 6 rows.

### Pseudo Code for the Pattern

1. **Start the program.**

2. **Outer Loop**:
   - Loop variable `i` starts from `6` and iterates down to `1` (inclusive).
   - Represents the number of rows.

3. **Inner Loop**:
   - Loop variable `j` starts from `i` and iterates down to `1` (inclusive).
   - In each iteration, print an asterisk (`*`).

4. **End of Inner Loop**:
   - After printing asterisks for one row, print a newline character to move to the next row.

5. **Stop the program.**
