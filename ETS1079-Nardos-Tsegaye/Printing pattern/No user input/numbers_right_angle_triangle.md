## Pattern: Right-Angled Number Triangle

### Input
1. No explicit input from the user.

### Output
1. A right-angled triangle pattern of numbers where each row contains consecutive numbers starting from 1 up to the row number.

### Pseudo Code for the Pattern

1. **Start the program.**

2. **Outer Loop**:
   - Loop variable `i` starts from `1` and iterates up to `5` (inclusive).
   - Represents the number of rows.

3. **Inner Loop**:
   - Loop variable `j` starts from `1` and iterates up to `i` (inclusive).
   - In each iteration, print the current value of `j`.

4. **End of Inner Loop**:
   - After printing numbers for one row, print a newline character to move to the next row.

5. **Stop the program.**
