2. **Outer Loop**:
   - Loop variable `i` starts from `1` and iterates up to `5` (inclusive).
   - Represents the number of rows.

3. **Inner Loop**:
   - Loop variable `j` starts from `1` and iterates up to `5` (inclusive).
   - In each iteration, print the current value of `j`.

4. **End of Inner Loop**:
   - After printing numbers for one row, print a newline character to move to the next row.

5. **Stop the program.**
