---

## **Pseudo Code**

1. **Start the program.**

2. **Declare variables:**
   - `alphabet` (character): Represents the current alphabet to print.

3. **Outer Loop (rows):**
   - Initialize `i` to 0.
   - Loop until `i <= 4` (inclusive):
     - Each iteration represents one row of the triangle.

4. **Inner Loop (columns):**
   - Set `alphabet` to 'A' at the start of each row.
 - Loop until `alphabet <= 'A' + i`:
     - **Print** the current value of `alphabet` (without moving to a new line).
     - **Increment** `alphabet` to the next letter.

5. **End of Inner Loop:**
   - **Print** a newline character to move to the next row.

6. **End of Outer Loop:**
   - Repeat steps 3-5 until all rows are completed.

7. **Stop the program.**
