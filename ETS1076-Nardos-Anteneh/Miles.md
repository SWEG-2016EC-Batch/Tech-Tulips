# Question 2: Automobile Fuel Efficiency Program

### Problem:
Write a program that prompts the capacity in gallons of an automobile fuel tank and the miles per gallon the automobile can be driven. The program should then output the number of miles the automobile can be driven without refueling.

### Pseudo-code:

1. Start
2. Prompt the user to input the fuel tank capacity (in gallons).
3. Prompt the user to input the miles the automobile can drive per gallon.
4. Calculate **Miles to Drive** = Fuel tank capacity * Miles per gallon.
5. Output the result: "The automobile can drive [Miles] miles without refueling."
6. End
