# Question 2: Fuel Tank Capacity

### Purpose  
This program figures out how far a car can go without refueling. All you need is the tank size (in gallons) and the miles per gallon (mpg).  

---

### Inputs  
1. How many gallons the tank holds.  
2. How many miles the car gets per gallon.  

---

### Output  
- The total distance the car can drive without needing to refuel.  

---

### Formula  
**Total Miles** = `Tank Capacity` Ã— `Miles Per Gallon`  

---

### Steps  
1. Ask the user how many gallons their tank holds.  
2. Ask them how many miles their car can drive per gallon.  
3. Multiply the two values to calculate the total distance.  
4. Show the result.  

---

### Code Breakdown  
- **Variables**:  
  - `tankCapacity`: How much gas the tank holds (gallons).  
  - `milesPerGallon`: How efficient the car is (mpg).  
  - `totalMiles`: How far the car can go (miles).  
- **Logic**:  
  - Multiply `tankCapacity` and `milesPerGallon`.  
  - Print the result.  

---

### Example  
**Input**:  
- Tank: 15 gallons  
- MPG: 25  

**Output**:  
The car can go 375 miles without refueling.
