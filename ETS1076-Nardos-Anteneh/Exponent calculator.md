# Expression Result Calculator Program

## Problem:
The program should compute the result of an expression where the values of `X` and `Y` are entered by the user. The expression used for this task is `X^Y`, which represents `X` raised to the power of `Y`.

### Task:
1. The program will prompt the user to input the values for `X` and `Y`.
2. It will compute the result of the expression `X^Y`.
3. It will output the result of this calculation.

## Pseudo-code:
1. Start the program.
2. Prompt the user to enter the values for `X` and `Y`.
3. Compute the result using the formula `X^Y`.
4. Display the result of the expression.
5. End the program.
