# Question 5: Salary Calculation Program

### Problem:
Design an algorithm and write a program that reads an employee's name, weekly working hours, bonus rate per hour, and base salary. The program should then calculate the **gross salary**, **net salary**, and **bonus payment** for the employee.

### Pseudo-code:

1. Start
2. Ask for employee name.
3. Ask for weekly working hours.
4. Ask for bonus rate per hour.
5. Ask for base salary.
6. Calculate **Gross Salary** = Base Salary + (Weekly Hours * Bonus Rate per Hour).
7. Calculate **Pension Deduction** = 5% of Gross Salary.
8. Calculate **Tax Deduction** = 15% of Gross Salary.
9. Calculate **Net Salary** = Gross Salary - (Pension Deduction + Tax Deduction).
10. Output **Gross Salary**, **Pension Deduction**, **Tax Deduction**, and **Net Salary**.
11. End
