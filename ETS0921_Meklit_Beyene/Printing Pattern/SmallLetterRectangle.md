# Pseudo code for alphabet small letter pattern

### Input
1. No explicit input from the user.

### Output
1. A pattern of lowercase alphabets 'a' to 'e', repeated for 5 rows:
   - Line 1: a b c d e  
   - Line 2: a b c d e  
   - Line 3: a b c d e  
   - Line 4: a b c d e  
   - Line 5: a b c d e  

### Pseudo Code

1. Start the program.

2. Outer Loop:
   - Loop variable i starts from 1 and iterates up to 5 (inclusive).
   - Represents the number of rows.

3. Inner Loop:
   - Initialize character alphabet to 'a' at the beginning of each outer loop iteration.
   - Iterate until alphabet is less than or equal to 'e'.
   - In each iteration:
     - Print the current value of alphabet.

4. End of Inner Loop:
   - After completing the inner loop for a row, print a newline character.

5. End of Outer Loop:
   - Repeat until all rows are printed.

6. Stop the program.
